#Happy Hour! (Austin Edition)

##Description
The purpose of this app is to showcase various restaurants with happy hour specials based on the user's geographical location in Austin, TX. It was inspired by my friends and our constant debates about where we should go for cheap drinks. This app is great for people who are new to Austin, college students, or simply stressed out from their jobs. If your looking for a way to relax on a small budget; this is the app is for you!
